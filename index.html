	<p>Venezuela is a land of great variety. It has Andean peaks, endless Caribbean coastline with amazing sandy beaches, small offshore islands and keys for the extreme travelers, extensive grasslands with wildlife, the Amazon rainforest and a rolling savanna punctuated by flat-topped mountains called tepuis. Have you seen the Pixar movie UP? This movie was filmed in the amazing tepuis and it even included Angel Falls, the world's highest waterfall. </p>

	<p>Those seeking adventure will find hiking, snorkeling, scuba diving, kite-surfing, windsurfing, paragliding and more. Even better, most of these attractions lie within a one-day bus trip of each other!</p>
